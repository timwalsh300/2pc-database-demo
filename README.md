# 2pc-database-demo

This was an academic project with the goals of demonstrating a nearest-neighbor (kNN) search for restaurants in the Yelp Dataset, and demonstrating the two-phase commit (2PC) protocol to insert new 
restaurants into a distributed system with multiple nodes. The project-report.pdf explains the details of system design, configuration, usage, and limitations. It requires access to the Yelp dataset, 
installation and configuration a database management system on multiple networked machines, and access to the Yelp and Google Maps APIs.
